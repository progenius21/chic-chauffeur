# Rover P5B Image Setup

## Image File Required
Please save the Rover P5B front-facing image as:
```
public/images/rover-p5b-front.jpg
```

## Image Specifications
- **Format**: JPG (optimized for web)
- **Recommended size**: 1200x800px or similar aspect ratio
- **Quality**: High quality but web-optimized (80-90% compression)
- **File size**: Under 500KB for optimal loading

## Implementation Details
The image has been strategically integrated in three locations:

1. **Hero Section Background** (Subtle, 5% opacity)
   - Creates atmospheric background without overwhelming text
   - Maintains clean, readable design

2. **Fleet Showcase** (Primary display)
   - Full-width hero image with overlay text
   - Showcases the vehicle as the main feature
   - Includes gradient overlay for text readability

3. **Heritage Section** (Complementary storytelling)
   - Square aspect ratio for balanced layout
   - Reinforces the heritage narrative
   - Includes subtle overlay text

## Design Considerations
- All images use Next.js Image optimization
- Responsive sizing implemented
- Proper alt text for accessibility
- Priority loading for above-the-fold content
- Maintains the elegant, sophisticated design aesthetic

## Next Steps
1. Add the image file to `public/images/rover-p5b-front.jpg`
2. Test the website to ensure proper loading
3. Adjust image quality/size if needed for optimal performance
